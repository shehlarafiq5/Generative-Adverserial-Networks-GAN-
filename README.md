# Generative-Adverserial-Networks-GAN-
## GAN on MNIST Dataset
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) applied to the MNIST dataset. The GAN is designed to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits that resemble those in the MNIST dataset.
Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:

- torch (PyTorch)    
- torchvision   
- matplotlib    
- numpy   
## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The dataset is automatically downloaded by the torchvision library.
